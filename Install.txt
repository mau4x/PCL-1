Installation instructions:

1. Choose root directory where PCL build tree will reside (eg. C:\PCL_BUILD).

2. Unzip the build container PCL.Vx.y.Win32.zip into this directory.

3. Choose target directory where PCL itself will reside 
	- may not be the same as build directory (eg. C:\PCL).

4. Run tuner.bat from the build directory giving it as the parameter target directory
	C:\PCL_BUILD>tuner C:\PCL

5. Open PCL.sln with Microsoft Visual Studio 2005.
6. Click Tools->Options. Select Directory tab. 
	Add C:\PCL\Include to the end of "Include files" list;
	add C:\PCL\Bin to the end of "Executable files" list;
	add C:\PCL\Lib to the end of "Library files" list.
   (surely, C:\PCL here is the placeholder for your chosen target directory).

7. Click Build->Batch Build... and press "Rebuild All" button. 

	Everything is gonna be allrigt, yeh!!!

8. Close PCL.dsw and open AppWizards\AppWizards.dsw. Click Build->Batch Build... and then

   choices: PCL Console Application, PCL DCOM Inproc Server and PCL Service Application.
   Create test project and assure that PCL installed well by building and runninig it.
